### Two "thought experiments" - Seeking the storytelling possibilities

**Q1**. Identify a “text” story, i.e., an investigative report in SCMP, WSJ, Guardian, FT (Chinese), Nanfang’s, Jiemian, and seek possible ways to turn it into a data-driven story (try to add some data source and charts);

**Q2**. identify a “data-driven journalism” piece, i.e., a data story from HK01, Initium, Bloomberg Interactive, Guardian Interactive, FT data, Caixin data, and seek possible ways to turn it into a text story (“de-datafication” – try to “remove” as many charts and tables as you can).

**Q3**. (optional) identify an “infographics” (懶人包/圖解) news, and repeat the above two.

For each of the above question, try to ask these questions:
1. What is the problem/gap defined by the news story?
2. What is the data source? Can we have more or less data sources?
3. Can we add or remove the data analysis methods?
(for this course) Why or why not use web scraping?
4. Can the presentation layout be changed? If so, how? If not, why?
